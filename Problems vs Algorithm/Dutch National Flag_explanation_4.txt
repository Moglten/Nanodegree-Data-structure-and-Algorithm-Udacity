Problem 4:-


###Design
---------------------------------
Considering n as length of list
---------------------------------

1- I initialize 3 pointers to first index for 0s and  second last Index for 2s and iterator .

2- If i find 0 in the iterator index will replace with what in 
   zero's index.

3- if i find 2 i will make as i make in in 0 put with last   	
   index.

4- if i find 1 will move on by iterator pointer .


###Time Complexity 

- Simple program that loop one time through my list so that over 
  all taking : O(n).


###Space Complexity

- Here i didn't make any clones or another list to use, i was  
  modifying inputed list so no auxiliery memory.

- O(1)
