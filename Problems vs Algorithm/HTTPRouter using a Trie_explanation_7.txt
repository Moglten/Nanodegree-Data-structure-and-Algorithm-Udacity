Problem 7:-


###Design


1- in add handler method i just use insert of trie node i made 
   to get right place of putting that handler.

2- in lookup method i also was making find method to find 
   handler of the path.

3- and Using split method to get right path.


### Time Complexity

- n here is a Length of path 

- Add handler Method :-

    - that using insert method i declared in RouteTrie class 
      the insert method ,taking O(n).
	
- Look up Method :-

    - By Using the find method in RouteTrie class that simple  
      taking O(n) by walk through elements of Trie .

- overall that take O(n).


### Space Complexity


- n here is a element in Trie 

- i make replacing or add in same tire so i didnt use any   
  Auxiliary memory overall that take : O(1)
