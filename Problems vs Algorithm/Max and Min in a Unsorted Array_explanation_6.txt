problem 6 :- 

###Desgin 
-------------------------------
Consider n as length of input 
-------------------------------


1- Declare 2 variable are min and max putting them in value of
   first item in list .

2- Then, using Linear search for finding min value in the list and max value.


###Time Complexity 

- What we did , i looping through the elements of the list that take O(n)

###Space Complexity

-i didin't use any auxiliary memory just i declare 2 intger variables and that approximating to : O(1)
