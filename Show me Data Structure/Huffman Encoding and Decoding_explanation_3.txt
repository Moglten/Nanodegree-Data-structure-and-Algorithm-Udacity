in huffman encodding i used 3 function around 

1- checking if phrease i have is not empty else

2- making heap of all letter i have with the frequancy they apper in phrease by making it in node have both 

3 - modifiy in heap that ( heapfiyup and heapifydown ) to handle that case of input is node not number 

4 - by using heap and node making a large tree have letter and number of frequancy of each one 

5 - declearing codes as golobal variale and modifiy it by making codes function by treaversing in tree i have and use make codes in dict to finally encode phrease 
 
6 - in decoding i used while and stack to treaverse in tree with code i have when i hit letter i append it to my phrease again

time efficancy : O(nLog(n))
space efficancy : O(n)
